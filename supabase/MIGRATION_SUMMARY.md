# Promptly Database Migration Summary

This document summarizes the database changes implemented to optimize the Supabase database structure for the Promptly application.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Security Enhancements

**Migration File:** `01_security_rls_policies.sql`

- Enabled Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Created RLS policies for each table to ensure data isolation between users
- Implemented proper access control for all operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

**Benefits:**
- Prevents unauthorized access to user data
- Ensures each user can only access their own data
- Provides defense-in-depth security at the database level

### 2. Data Integrity Improvements

**Migration File:** `02_foreign_key_constraints.sql`

- Added missing foreign key constraints between related tables
- Implemented proper ON DELETE CASCADE referential actions
- Ensured data consistency across the database

**Benefits:**
- Prevents orphaned records when parent records are deleted
- Maintains referential integrity between related tables
- Improves data quality and consistency

### 3. Performance Optimizations

**Migration File:** `03_performance_indexes.sql`

- Added indexes for frequently queried columns
- Created composite indexes for common query patterns
- Optimized database performance for common operations

**Benefits:**
- Significantly improves query performance
- Reduces database load for common operations
- Enhances application responsiveness

### 4. Query Efficiency Improvements

**Migration File:** `04_performance_views.sql`

- Created a `templates_with_prompts` view to solve N+1 query issues
- Implemented efficient joins between templates and prompts
- Applied RLS policies to the view for security

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates N+1 query problem in template fetching
- Reduces the number of database queries needed
- Improves application performance and reduces latency

### 5. Data Validation Enhancements

**Migration File:** `05_data_integrity.sql`

- Added unique constraints for template titles per user
- Implemented check constraints for data validation
- Set default values for nullable columns

**Benefits:**
- Prevents duplicate template titles for the same user
- Ensures data meets quality standards
- Provides sensible defaults for optional fields

### 6. Data Model Improvements

**Migration File:** `06_tags_system.sql`

- Implemented a proper tags system with many-to-many relationships
- Created a `prompts_with_tags` view for efficient retrieval
- Added support for multiple tags per prompt

**Benefits:**
- Provides a more flexible tagging system
- Improves organization and categorization of prompts
- Enhances search and filtering capabilities

### 7. Security for Sensitive Data

**Migration File:** `07_security_encryption.sql`

- Added support for encrypting sensitive prompt content
- Implemented secure encryption and decryption functions
- Created a `secure_prompts` view for accessing encrypted data

**Benefits:**
- Protects sensitive prompt content from unauthorized access
- Provides an option for users to encrypt their prompts
- Maintains security while preserving functionality

## Application Code Updates

The following application code files were updated to use the new database structure:

1. **src/integrations/supabase/types.ts**
   - Updated type definitions to match the new database schema
   - Added types for new tables, views, and functions

2. **src/hooks/usePrompts.ts**
   - Updated to use the `prompts_with_tags` view
   - Added support for the new tagging system
   - Implemented encryption functionality

3. **src/hooks/useTemplates.ts**
   - Updated to use the `templates_with_prompts` view
   - Eliminated N+1 query issues
   - Added template deletion functionality

## Performance Impact

The implemented changes have significantly improved the application's performance:

- **Before:** Fetching templates required 1 + N + N queries (1 for templates, N for template_prompts, N for prompts)
- **After:** Fetching templates requires just 1 query using the `templates_with_prompts` view

- **Before:** No indexes on frequently queried columns
- **After:** Proper indexes on all frequently queried columns and composite indexes for common query patterns

## Security Impact

The security posture of the application has been greatly enhanced:

- **Before:** No Row Level Security, relying on application code for data isolation
- **After:** Comprehensive RLS policies ensuring data isolation at the database level

- **Before:** No encryption for sensitive data
- **After:** Optional encryption for sensitive prompt content

## Next Steps

1. Update the application's UI to support the new features:
   - Multi-tag selection for prompts
   - Encryption toggle for sensitive prompts
   - Improved template management

2. Implement a data migration script to:
   - Populate the new tags table based on existing tag values
   - Create prompt_tags relationships for existing prompts
   - Set up encryption for prompts marked as sensitive

3. Update the application's documentation to reflect the new features and capabilities.
