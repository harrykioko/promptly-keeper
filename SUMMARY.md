# Promptly Database Audit and Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the database audit and implementation work completed for the Promptly application. The goal was to ensure a robust, efficient, and type-safe database structure that supports all the application's requirements.

## Completed Tasks

### Database Schema Audit

1. Identified missing indexes on foreign key columns
2. Identified missing foreign key constraints
3. Analyzed table relationships and data integrity requirements
4. Reviewed column types and nullability constraints

### Database Migrations

1. Created migration files to add missing indexes:
   - `20230501000001_add_indexes.sql`

2. Created migration files to add missing foreign key constraints:
   - `20230501000002_add_foreign_keys.sql`

3. Created migration files for additional improvements:
   - `20230501000003_add_updated_at_to_prompts.sql`
   - `20230501000004_add_version_tracking.sql`
   - `20230501000005_add_usage_tracking.sql`

### Type Definitions

1. Created comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for the database schema:
   - `src/types/database.ts`

2. Implemented type-safe Supabase client:
   - `src/lib/supabase.ts`

3. Created custom React hooks for database operations:
   - `src/hooks/useSupabase.ts`

### Documentation

1. Created detailed README files:
   - `README.md` - Main project documentation
   - `supabase/README.md` - Database structure documentation

2. Created a migration application script:
   - `scripts/apply-migrations.js`

## Database Structure

The database consists of the following tables:

1. `users` - User information
2. `prompts` - AI prompts created by users
3. `categories` - Categories for organizing prompts
4. `prompt_versions` - Version history of prompts
5. `prompt_usage` - Usage tracking for prompts
6. `shared_prompts` - Prompts shared between users

Each table has appropriate indexes and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity and query performance.

## Type Safety

The implementation includes comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for the database schema, ensuring type safety throughout the application. The types include:

1. Table row types (e.g., `Prompt`, `Category`)
2. Insert types (e.g., `NewPrompt`, `NewCategory`)
3. Update types (e.g., `UpdatePrompt`, `UpdateCategory`)
4. Relationship definitions

## Next Steps

1. Update application components to use the new type definitions
2. Implement additional database features as needed
3. Set up automated testing for database operations
4. Monitor database performance in production
